          <h3 class="titles" id="Hobbies">My Hobbies</h3>
          <dl>
            <dt>Programming personal projects</dt>
            <dd>
              This is what I do when I have free time at home I come up with
              some project ideas on my own and start to code them out using
              proper software engineering procedures. Not all the projects I
              work on are from my own forwishen, most of them are projects done
              before by other programmers in videos or in articles
            </dd>
            <dt>Playing Video Games</dt>
            <dd>
              When I have the time I try some video games to see how they work
              and what types of things are possible to do now a days. Playing
              video games is not really a hobbie per say it is something I do
              whenever I need to find some ideas for projects
            </dd>
            <dt>Cooking</dt>
            <dd>
              Cooking is an art not just a mear action it is a process that
              every software engineer should take part, or at least that is what
              I believe. Cooking is an art for software engineers because it is
              a practical example of when algorithms can be used in real life
              situations
            </dd>
            <dt>Working out</dt>
            <dd>
              Is is quiet a must before and after sleeping and in between study
              sessions. Exersice can be helpful to clear the mind of the trubles
              of education of a short time and recharge the batteries
            </dd>
            <dt>Listening to music</dt>
            <dd>
              This is when I'm stuck on a question or when I'm programming and
              trubleshooting, so listening to music is an activity I reserve for
              solving problems that are simple not complex once where I need to
              design something or solve a really hard question.
            </dd>
            <dt>Playing board games</dt>
            <dd>
              This is more of a family activity where there are guests over at
              the house. I have found this to be a really clever way to study
              when there are people at the house.
            </dd>
            <dt>Reading</dt>
            <dd>
              Reading happens all the time whenever I'm working so I thought why
              not imporove that skill by reading outside of work as well, during
              any activity I seem to be engaged in like walking or just sitting
              somewhere I look for something to read be it out in the enviroment
              I find my self in or on my phone
            </dd>
            <dt>Writing</dt>
            <dd>
              I used to be a bad speller of words even of the most common types
              this has really helped me improve that skill
            </dd>
            <dt>Playing musical instruments</dt>
            <dd>
              This I was told will improve my rethem when I'm doing almost any
              thing like typing or writing or reading. This is more of a recent
              undertaking I'm not really good at it but I'm not giving up just
              yet
            </dd>
            <dt>Solving logic games and puzzles</dt>
            <dd>
              This is an activity reserved for when the light is out at the
              house or when it is lunch time at school and I have nothing better
              to do. Doing this, I hope will improve my problem solving skills
              quiet a bit especially after it is coupled with problem solving in
              leetcode, hackerrank and codeforces
